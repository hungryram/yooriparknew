If you are thinking about owning your first home here are information to fully prepare you.

One thing I’ve heard many people say is I should have bought it before. And you’ll probably say it again, if you can own a home and you decided not to. If you’re going to live in the home for more than 7 years then don’t be hesitant to buy. If you think the 2008 catastrophe will happen again, it won’t because they won’t make the same mistake twice. They are not giving out mortgages easily to people. And there are less delinquencies now. (I will be posting another blog post about this. You should NOT fear what is going on.)

Are there still buyers? In Los Angeles, YES! There are still many buyers here. I can only speak about Los Angeles.

What is the first step into owning a home? The first step is to talk to your lender. This is important. (If you don’t have a lender then message me I can refer you). This is really the first step. You need to know your approved price. They will let you know if you need a co-signer, more proof of funds, and etc. They can tell you all the different loan programs that will fit you. Once you know, then it’s easier for you and the agent to look for your home. It narrows down your search – possibly a change of location, look at less homes now in your price range instead of the whole inventory, and it will save you time. And another important thing is since there aren’t many homes in the inventory, and you found one that you absolutely like then you will have the pre-approval ready to go to put in the offer. It helps you in the end, and it sets you up for success when you want to put in the offer.

Don’t assume you can buy a home at your own thought price. It might not be the actual price you thought it would be. It could be less or even more. And for some of you who did not think you can buy a home you might be surprised you might be able to or be surprised you’re paying the same amount of rent.

I want to tell you that sometimes your first home is not your actual dream home. You want that big yard with a pool so you can lay out and relax sipping your drink. You want two big master’s closets to fit all your clothes. You want a big dining area to host a great dinner party. Or maybe have your own separate bathroom. Some of you might be able to get that first dream home, and some might not. You might live in a condo/townhouse first or a smaller home. Don’t let that discourage you! Look at the smart and brighter side – YOU HAVE Real Estate!!! If you can buy a home you are putting money back into you, and it’s better than a CD at a bank. And you can always renovate some parts of your home later or wait. The valuable asset that you have will be the ticket to your next home, business (from your equity), or investments.

Another advice is make sure you have money for the closing cost, and to pay all your inspectors. This is separate from your down payment or you can take it out from your down payment if it’s possible. When you buy a resale home it’s always best to inspect the home – YOU SHOULD have the inspectors inspect the home. Your agent should let you know. You will have to have professionals come out to inspect the home – General Inspection to very specific inspections such as Sewer, Termite, Chimney, and etc. It’s all up to you how much more inspections you would like to do. This happens during Escrow, and remember this is not a new home. Resale is not a brand new home.

Now, for your professional help is to find your Real Estate Agent that will work for you. If you are buying a home you are not paying your agent after the close of Escrow. The Seller who is selling the home is paying your Agent. You win either way. You have an Agent who works for you, and you will get a home after close of Escrow. Do not think your Real Estate Agent is just finding you homes and looking at the homes with you. There are more to what a good agent does. They will write your offer, make sure all your contracts/disclosures are organized and sent to you (be prepared for a lot of paperwork during Escrow), make sure the dates (loan contingency, appraisal, repairs, and etc.) are not missed, the most important is they will negotiate with the other agent during Escrow, and more.

If you have any more questions there is a question box on the home page or contact me. I have more information for you coming soon to help you on your home buying journey.
