Old world charm & romantic provenance come together in a symphony of splendor with this charming 1920’s Spanish Hacienda high in the Hollywood Hills. Located in historic Whitley Heights up a quiet street, a wrought iron gate & beautiful landscaping set the stage as a double story tile entry leads to a living room w/fireplace replete with wood floors & beautifully curved ceilings. The story continues as a formal dining room, sun room & chef’s kitchen with stainless appliances compliment a breakfast & powder room on the main floor. Moving upstairs, 3 bedrooms + 2 tiled baths, including a master w/dual closets, are the perfect spot to unwind. At garden level is the 4th bedroom w family/TV room w/fireplace that opens to a charming patio & lawn overlooking sweeping views of the Observatory & iconic Capitol Records building. Completing the ground floor is an en-suite bedroom w/bath + laundry. Write your own screenplay in this rare offering located in one of LA’s most historic neighborhoods.
