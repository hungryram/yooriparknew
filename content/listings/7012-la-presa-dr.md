Designed by famed architect Leland Fuller & later expanded and renovated by another famed architect John Woolf, this glamorous 1930’s Traditional sits among a collection of fine homes in prestigious Outpost Estates. Once beyond the gated motor court, designer touches combine with gleaming ebonized wood floors to frame scenic Observatory, hillside & cityscape views of Downtown. Natural light dances from the living room w/fireplace to a grand dining room w/banks of windows overlooking a patio surrounded by lush foliage & city views beyond. A chef’s kitchen complete w/stone counters, custom cabinets, and high-end stainless appliances is patio-adjacent for easy outdoor & bbq access. Three bedroom + 3 baths, including 2 master suites, one w/a huge veranda patio w/dazzling views, are the perfect spot to unwind, whilst multiple garden paths, waterfalls & wading pool add to the regal splendor. 2 car garage & central hvac round out this truly exceptional offering!
