Nestled behind hedges on a quiet street just steps from Melrose Ave, this Mediterranean beauty is ideal for a family or the consummate entertainer. Enter through wrought iron gates & up to the front patio covered by a custom pergola. Appreciate the abundant natural light in the spacious, open concept floor plan. Exuding warmth & style with hardwood floors throughout, the living room w/ fireplace flows into the dining & kitchen. Under an oversized skylight, the gourmet kitchen offers granite countertops & stainless-steel appliances. Socialize around the generous island or open the French doors to dine al fresco. The luxurious master suite has a walk-in closet, double sinks & soaking tub. Two more bedrooms & full bath round out the home. The family room is ideal as office by day, mini-theater at night. The secluded, quiet yard has room for a pool. Total square footage includes 1,814 sf main house plus 456 bonus sf family room. An oasis in the city steps off of Melrose.
