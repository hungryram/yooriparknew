Luxury head on view home at less than $1350 a square foot! Priced to sell. Designed and executed with passion and detail, exudes style, warmth and great vibes. Fully furnished (potentially included) contemporary view home features 3 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms with panoramic views of the city, mountain and the pacific ocean, which can be seen from every room. Open concept main level opens to a sleek top of the line kitchen with floor to ceiling sliding glass doors. Open dining area and a sweet entertaining living room steps away from an expansive outdoor entertainment space. Beautiful infinity edge pool and spa with a rare oversized deck, barbecue area, bar plus fire-pit, all overlooking the Jaw dropping city skyline. This property truly has it all! Perfectly located on a wide part of Sunset Plaza Drive just above the Sunset strip, minutes to everything fun in LA. The street has so much space just outside the front door which allows for friends and family to visit and easily park their cars. 1995 Sunset plaza has a rare and large motor court that is partially covered. This home would not only be terrific place to live but could most likely earn you $500,000+ year (conservatively) in rental income.
