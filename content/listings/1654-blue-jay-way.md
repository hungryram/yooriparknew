Architectural by Famed AIA Zoltan Pali with potential upside! Commanding the top of the most famous bird streets, 1654 Blue Jay Way is the height of sophisticated architecture. Every room seems to float over the lights of LA, with astounding views from Downtown to the Pacific. A mirrored alcove in the billiards room is actually a window into the swimming pool; the glass floor of a catwalk is also the ceiling of the wine cellar. Complete with gym, screening room and fully-equipped nightclub, is a re-imagining of the home of the future.
