Magical tower for sale in a historical Chateau Estate surrounded by 40 plush, park-like acres with orchards, a greenhouse, forest, formal and wild gardens, woodlands, moat (now dry), and ornamental ponds with a pool and tennis court. The home is fully equipped on 3 floors plus a loft and a converted stone cave with Sauna. The tower enjoys the largest private garden terrace on the estate with its own David Austin Rose Tunnel looking out onto the french garden, orchard, and greenhouse. On buying a property at this chateau, you will individually own your house, jointly own the 40-acre grounds and some areas within the Chateau and outbuildings. These include the Chateau’s original kitchen with a huge fireplace and range cooker, the impressive entrance hall, the petit salon that opens onto the rear terrace with sweeping staircases down to the gardens, and a beautiful little church with stained glass windows that can be used for family weddings, christenings, etc. Also jointly owned is the Pigeonaire Tower complete with a basement prison and 2 cottages one of which houses the caretakers who live on-site and the other is currently being renovated as guest accommodation. This kind of co-ownership is very normal in France with clear legislation that all ownerships must adhere to and Chateau la Trousse has a well-organized and efficient management team and Syndic. The co-ownership is 28 people owning a total of 34 houses or apartments. There is a mixture of nationalities and ages so both us and our children have made some great friends at La Trousse. All properties can be used for permanent or holiday residence though currently all are used as holiday homes. The majority of properties are used only by the owners or their families and the number of occupied properties averages to Winter months 4/5, Spring and Autumn months 6/8, Summer months, Christmas and New Year 10 /12, obviously these numbers can fluctuate and very often we have enjoyed the estate completely to ourselves. With ‘on site’ caretakers who will check your property while your not using it, regulate access onto the estate for security, set up your house ready for your arrival then clean and launder after you leave. The Chateau offers a hassle/stress-free way to really enjoy owning and spending time in your holiday home. This Chateau is conveniently located in the Ile de France area, department Seine et Marne. It is a short drive from Paris, Euro Disney, or the Champagne capitals Reims and Epernay. There is a motorway and mainline train access close by. Fairytale living exists here which offers great peace of mind in mature landscaping, birds signing away from hectic city life but close enough to Paris to get all the culture, dining, museums, and shopping. Best of both worlds in Ile de France.
