The astonishing studs-out transformation of this Windsor Square 2 story Dutch Colonial has resulted in a flawless 5 bedroom, 5Â½ bath compound with separate guest house, seamlessly combining classic and contemporary design elements on a street-to-street lot with private gated street access off Van Ness Ave. No system or finish has been overlooked in this truly remarkable re-imagining - from the exquisite open plan kitchen with marble counters & top of the line Viking appliances, to the spacious bedroom suites, all with private marble bathrooms, to the stunning public rooms that open through French doors to gorgeous resort-like grounds with a grand dining patio, sparkling new swimming pool and over-sized spa, framed on the north side by a spacious separate guest house and pool cabana. This is a remarkable property and an exceptional opportunity.
