review = "Booking process was easy, I was able to get an appointment that was less than 2 hours from the time I called in. I didn’t have to wait long in the reception area at all. Corinne was fantastic, she addressed my specific needs (car accident pain) really well and wasn’t afraid to do the work I needed to get some relief from my back, neck, and shoulder pain!"
