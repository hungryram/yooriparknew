I would recommend her to any of my family or friends looking to buy real estate from first time buyers to experienced investors looking for a great investment. Yoori is very knowledgeable in the industry and helped me to find a property with incredible AVR potential! She has an eye and vision for investment opportunities and upcoming areas in Los Angeles."

testimonial = "Buying a house is a major decision and commitment and expectations high. Yoori understands and is committed to providing service that does not disappoint. After having gone through disappointing agents who didn’t follow through, Yoori gave us list of properties that excited our search, narrowing it down to our dream home. Yoori was with us through each step and helped us negotiate the process of escrow, and closing the deal for us."

testimonial = "Yoori Park is not only my real estate agent but we are now life long friends! She made my home buying experience one to remember. Yoori gained my trust and respect very early on; I felt cared for and at ease that everything would turn out the way it was supposed to. She made herself available to me at all times and always followed through on her promises. I can’t say enough good things about her."
